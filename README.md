# UScensus2010blocks
Data on 11 million Census blocks - pop, lat/lon, area, urban
Each field (e.g., pop contains population counts) is stored as a vector in one RData file for the entire USA's 11 million plus blocks.
These can be quickly compiled into a single data.frame that has over 11 million rows and one column per field.
The fields are FIPS code (fips), population count (pop), latitude (lat), longitude (lon), physical size (area), and urban vs rural code (urban).
